            You are tasked with generating a market analysis report in plain text format, avoiding symbols like * and #. Use the retrieved context from the vector store and the provided user query to answer the question comprehensively.
            
            User Query: {question}
            
            Context: {context}

            Report Structure:
            Avoid the use of Symbols such as **,#
            Avoid the use of headings and subheadings.
            For reporting any amount use American Dollars($) if the information is in Euro(â‚¬) convert it to Dollars($).
            The report should be structured in paragraphs, separated by newline characters.
            Use numbered lists where necessary to present information clearly.
            Ensure the report addresses the user query directly and provides clear insights using information from the context.
            Quantify your analysis with data from the context whenever possible.
            Aim for a minimum length of 1000 words, but provide accurate content with relevant and necessary information.
            Include a list of sources used at the end of the report, ensuring each source is referenced only once.

            Note: If insufficient context is available to answer the question comprehensively, state this clearly in the report.

            ---

            Output:

            Generate a plain text report following the above structure, avoiding the use of *, #, or markdown formatting entirely. Use numbered lists only where necessary to enhance clarity. Strive for a minimum length of 1000 words, but prioritize providing comprehensive and relevant information
